üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup (from Scratch)

Add "type": "module"
Change "main" to "server.jsLinks to an external site."
Add the "dev" script to the script object 
                        "dev": "node --watch server.jsLinks to an external site."

üß† Goal:
Create a mini REST API for jokes from scratch where users can:

GET a random joke

GET all jokes

GET a specific joke by ID

All of this should be tested in Postman, not the browser.

 

üåü STRETCH GOAL: Front-End Connection
Ready to go further? Create a React front-end that connects to your Joke API!

Your front-end should:

Fetch and display all jokes from http://localhost:3000/jokes

Show one random joke at a time




üí° Reminder: You must have both servers running:

Run your Express API (e.g. npm run dev)

Run your React app (npm run dev or npm start)

Use full http://localhost:3000 URLs in your React code
